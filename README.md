# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project Link : https://ghanshyam-wadaskar.github.io/Calendar-Application-for-Communication-Tracking/ 
a. Setup and Deployment Instructions
Provide instructions to set up and run the application locally and deploy it. This can include:

Installation:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
Running Locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Building for Production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploying:

GitHub Pages:
Add the gh-pages configuration as mentioned in the previous response.
Deploy using:
bash
Copy code
npm run deploy
Vercel/Netlify:
You can deploy through their UI by connecting your GitHub repository.
b. Application Functionality
Explain the core features and how users can interact with the application. Include:

User Dashboard: Viewing and logging communication actions.
Admin Section: Managing communication methods and companies.
Reporting: Viewing communication frequency and trends, and downloading reports.
c. Known Limitations
Mention any known issues or limitations in the app. For example:

Mobile Responsiveness: If the application isn’t fully responsive.
Missing Features: If certain features like authentication or more advanced reporting are missing.
3. Deployment
Deploy your app on one of the platforms mentioned (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages). After deployment, provide a live URL in the README file and through your submission:

GitHub Pages: https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
Vercel/Netlify: Platform will provide the live URL.
4. Testing & Validation
Make sure your application works smoothly:

Error-Free Execution: Test that the application runs without runtime errors.
Usability Testing: Check that the user interface is intuitive and functional. Try performing actions like logging communications, viewing reports, etc.
Performance: Ensure the app runs smoothly with no noticeable lag. Use Chrome’s Developer Tools for performance profiling if needed.
a. Sample Data
Provide mock data for companies, communication methods, etc. This can be either hardcoded in the code or you can create mock API endpoints. Ensure that these mock data sets are included in your repository for evaluation.

Example:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "companyName": "ABC Corp",
    "communicationMethod": "Email",
    "schedule": "Weekly"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "companyName": "XYZ Inc",
    "communicationMethod": "Phone",
    "schedule": "Monthly"
  }
]
5. Evaluation Criteria
a. Code Quality
Ensure your code is clean and maintainable:

Use meaningful variable and function names.
Follow standard React practices (functional components, hooks, prop types).
Handle state management effectively.
b. Functionality
The app should meet all feature requirements such as:

Overdue, Due, and Completed Communications: Ensure your logic is correct, with communication actions properly marked as overdue, due, or completed.
Reports: Ensure the reporting section is working as expected, with graphs or tables showing communication trends.
c. User Experience
The interface should be intuitive with proper use of color highlights for overdue communications and tooltips for better clarity.
The app should be responsive (especially for mobile devices) and provide a smooth user experience.
d. Performance
The app should be performant, even when loading a large set of data or rendering charts.
Optimize unnecessary renders or API calls to ensure a fast experience.
e. Creativity and Innovation
Implement any additional features you think would improve the user experience. For example:
Real-time notifications for due or overdue communications.
Dynamic charts that update automatically when new communication data is logged.
6. Additional Notes
Login Credentials: If your application requires a login for admin or user access, provide the credentials (username/password) to access these sections in your submission email.
External Libraries: List all libraries and frameworks used in the project, such as:
React Router for routing.
Chart.js for charting (as in your previous questions).
Tailwind CSS for styling (if used).
